## Hobbies

Let's talk about hobbies!

I like watching movies/series, especially action, thriller, drama biography, and comedy. I prefer Hollywood, English, and European movies/series rather than Asian. I'm not into colossal movies/series. I'm recently focusing my interest on movies/series in a superhero genre like Marvel Cinematic Universe and DC Universe. Because indeed, for me, it's interesting.

Besides watching movies/series, I once like playing games. But recently, I don't feel like it. I have Call of Duty Modern Warfare and GTA 5 installed on my laptop, but there is not enough interest to play them. I would play a game when it comes to Spider-Man game on PlayStation 5 because I like Spider-Man very much. Spider-Man is my favorite superhero.<br><br>

## Interests

I'm interested in Programming, Hacking, Freelancing, and Travelling. I'm still in the progress of becoming a Freelancer and Traveller. Not sure about Hacking, though. I'm just interested in that.<br><br>
