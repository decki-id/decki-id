## Hobbies

Let's talk about hobbies!

I like watching movies/series, especially action, thriller, drama biography, and comedy. I prefer Hollywood, English, and European movies/series rather than Asian. I'm not into colossal movies/series. I'm recently focusing my interest on movies/series in a superhero genre like Marvel Cinematic Universe and DC Universe. Because indeed, for me, it's interesting.

Besides watching movies/series, I once like playing games. But recently, I don't feel like it. I have Call of Duty Modern Warfare and GTA 5 installed on my laptop, but there is not enough interest to play them. I would play a game when it comes to Spider-Man game on PlayStation 5 because I like Spider-Man very much. Spider-Man is my favorite superhero.<br><br>

## Interests

I'm interested in Programming, Hacking, Freelancing, and Solo Travelling. I'm still in the progress of becoming a Freelancer and Solo Traveller. Not sure about Hacking, though. I'm just interested in that.<br><br>

## Passion

I'm passionate about everything that has to do with ten-finger typing. Because God, I love ten-finger typing! I love it to the point where I want to type a whole text instead of copy-paste it. But of course, I can only do that when there is no urgency, like a deadline or something.

What I like about ten-finger typing is not the speed, but the use of all ten fingers, including the little fingers. Even though I can do ten-finger typing, my typing speed is average. I don't care about the typing speed. I always feel infuriated when I see someone do ten-finger typing, but they don't use the little fingers.

For me, ten-finger typing is not about speed. It's about how each finger does its job in its position, including the little fingers.<br><br>
